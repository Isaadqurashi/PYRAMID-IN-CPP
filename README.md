# PYRAMID-IN-CPP
This C++ code generates a pyramid pattern based on user-specified levels. It uses nested loops to control the number of spaces and asterisks on each line, creating a pyramid shape. The user is prompted to input the number of levels, and the code dynamically adjusts the pattern accordingly.
